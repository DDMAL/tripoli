Tripoli is a validator for documents conforming to the `IIIF
presentation API 2.1 <http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/>`__. It makes
it easy to validate documents, apply provider specific heuristics, and
even correct documents while they are being validated.

Documentation
-------------

Detailed documentation is available at
http://tripoli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Installation
------------

Python 3.5+ is required to run Tripoli. You can install Tripoli using pip.

Quick start

Once installed, it's easy to start validating. Tripoli can validate the
entire document, and will log informative errors and warnings with
helpful paths.

.. code:: python

    >>> from tripoli import IIIFValidator

    >>> iv = IIIFValidator()
    >>> iv.validate(some_manifest)

        Error: viewingHint 'pages' is not valid and not uri. - data['sequences']['canvases']['viewingHint']
        Warning: logo SHOULD be IIIF image service. - data['logo']
        Warning: manifest SHOULD have thumbnail field. - data['thumbnail']
        Warning: Unknown key 'see_also' in 'manifest' - data['see_also']
