Tripoli Documentation
=====================

Tripoli is a validator for documents conforming to the
`IIIF presentation API 2.1 <http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/>`_.
The goals of this project are to:

* Be of use to implementors in designing a system that conforms to the API.
* Return errors and warnings that are detailed and helpful.
* Present an organized class structure to simplify overriding and extending behaviour.
* Provide a top level interface that it easy to use and integrate into an existing workflow.
